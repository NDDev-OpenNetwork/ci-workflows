"""Every third-party `uses:` must be pinned to a full 40-char commit SHA with a
version comment. Local reusable calls (`./.github/...`) are exempt.

A called workflow additionally may not reach a local *action* through `./`.
`./` resolves against the caller's workspace, never against the repository
holding the workflow, so `uses: ./actions/x` inside a `workflow_call` workflow
fails at job setup for every cross-repository consumer. This exemption used to
skip all `./` refs as "local reusable workflow", which is how five such
references shipped across 0.1.21..0.1.23 and broke both the CI-feedback path
and the private security bundle for every real caller.
